# Railway-The Main aim of Railway Management Mini DBMS project is to ease the process of railway reservation. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project. In this project, we first add the details of trains and their halting stations. Then passenger can book ticket by adding their details, source and Destination. Passenger module show number of passengers boarding to the station. Trains and Stations can be added or deleted and the train details can be updated for changing the timing on arrival and departure or just increasing or decreasing the amount for tickects based on classes such as 2A,3B,etc.
